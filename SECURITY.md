## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of **Win-Debloat7** seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.**
2.  Email details to the maintainers (or open a Draft Security Advisory if on GitHub).
3.  Provide steps to reproduce the issue.

## Safe Mode
Consider using the "Safe" profiles or `Safe` modes in functions (e.g., `Disable-WinDebloat7TelemetryTasks -Mode Safe`) if you are concerned about system stability or security implications of aggressive debloating.
