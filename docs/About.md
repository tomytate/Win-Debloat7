# About Win-Debloat7

## 📖 Description
**Win-Debloat7** is a professional-grade Windows 10/11 optimization framework tailored for power users, gamers, and system administrators. It streamlines the removal of pre-installed bloatware, hardens system privacy by disabling invasive telemetry, and tunes performance settings—all while prioritizing **safety** and **reversibility** via automated snapshots.

## 🛡️ The Philosophy
Win-Debloat7 was born from a simple frustration: Windows optimization scripts are often **opaque**, **destructive**, and **outdated**.

We built Win-Debloat7 to be the **"Gold Standard"**:
1.  **Transparency**: Every tweak is visible in the code. No compiled binaries (in Standard edition).
2.  **Safety**: We use official Microsoft APIs (PowerShell, DISM, Winget) rather than hacking registry keys blindly.
3.  **Modernity**: Built strictly for **PowerShell 7.5+**, leveraging new features like `clean` blocks, parallel loops, and improved security.
