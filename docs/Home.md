# Welcome to the Win-Debloat7 Wiki!

**Win-Debloat7** is a professional-grade Windows 10/11 optimization framework tailored for power users, gamers, and system administrators. Built on **PowerShell 7.5**, it prioritizes safety, reversibility, and modular configuration.

## 🚀 Key Differences

Unlike other debloaters, Win-Debloat7 focuses on:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code**: All settings are defined in YAML profiles (`profiles/`).
2.  **Safety First**: Uses DPAPI-encrypted snapshots for instant rollback.
3.  **No Binary Obfuscation**: 100% transparent PowerShell code. 
4.  **Hardware Awareness**: Auto-detects RAM, CPU (Intel/AMD), and GPU (NVIDIA/AMD) to apply optimized power plans.
